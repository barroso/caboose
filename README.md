Caboose
========
Use of Cabooses began in the 1830s, when railroads housed trainmen in shanties built onto boxcars or flatcars.

The caboose provided the train crew with a shelter at the rear of the train.

But we're not talking about trains, we're talking about software design. So here Caboose is simply a reminder of those great locomotives.

This project is a shelter for studying an API in Rails and Software Architecture.

## Ruby on Rails Api

Ruby is an interpreted object-oriented programming language often used for web development. It also offers many scripting features to process plain text and serialized files, or manage system tasks. It is simple, straightforward, and extensible.

## React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## Tailwindcss

Tailwindcss is an open-source CSS framework. The main feature of this library is that, unlike other CSS frameworks like Bootstrap, it does not provide a series of predefined classes for elements such as buttons or tables. 

Instead, it creates a list of "utility" CSS classes that can be used to style each element by mixing and matching.

## Docker

Docker is a tool that is used to automate the deployment of applications in lightweight containers so that applications can work efficiently in different environments in isolation.

Top Commands
```shell
docker --version
docker network create -d bridge web
docker compose build
docker compose up
docker ps --all
docker exec -it sample bash
docker network ls
docker volume ls
```

## Postgres

The PostgreSQL Global Development Group focuses only on developing a database engine and closely related components. This core is, technically, what comprises PostgreSQL itself, but there is an extensive developer community and ecosystem that provides other important feature sets that might, traditionally, be provided by a proprietary software vendor.
